# Contract

**Standard Hourly Rate**: 
	
**Purpose**: I will always do my best to fulfill your needs and meet your goals, but sometimes it's best to have a few things written down so that we both know what's what, who should do what, and what happens if stuff goes wrong. In this contract you won't find complicated legal terms or long passages of unreadable text. I have no desire to trick you into signing something that you might later regret. I do want what's best for the safety of both parties, now and in the future. **I hope you’ll read this contract thoroughly, and ask me about anything that’s unclear to you.**
	
**In short**: You are hiring me to provide you with ongoing business technology strategy services. The work we do together will hopefully continue for a long time over many projects, and as such, this contract will not contain project details. Instead, the purpose of this contract is to outline general terms for our professional relationship, applicable to any work we do together.

## What do both parties agree to do?
As my client, you affirm that you have the power and ability to enter into this contract on behalf of your company or organization. You agree to provide me with everything that I'll need to complete projects, including text, images and information, as and when I need it and in the format I ask for. You agree to review my work and provide feedback and approval in a timely manner. **Deadlines work both ways and you'll also be bound by any dates that we set together. You also agree to stick to the payment schedule at the end of this contract.**
	
I affirm that I have the experience and/or ability to perform the services you need from me and that I will carry them out in a professional and timely manner. Should you require services that are beyond my capabilities, I promise to tell you so and do my best to recommend resources to you. I will endeavor to meet all the deadlines set, but **I cannot be responsible for a missed launch date or deadline if you have been late in supplying materials or have not approved or signed off on my work on-time at any stage.** I'll also maintain the confidentiality of any information that you give me.

## Content & Purchases
**I am not responsible for writing or inputting any text, images, video, etc, unless otherwise agreed.** Generally, you are responsible for making any project-related purchases such as themes, photos, or hosting, though I will often do this for you if requested (and add the amount to your next invoice). You will supply me photographs in a standard digital format (.png, .jpg, .gif, etc.). If you choose to buy stock media, I can suggest vendors and sizes. Any time I spend searching for appropriate media will be charged at my standard hourly rate. Please refer to my [Content Provisioning Guidelines](http://www.blog.inneosg.com/development/wordpress/content-provisioning-guidelines/) for more detailed suggestions on how to provide content.
	
## Technical Support
I am not a web hosting service and typically do not offer or include technical support for website hosting, email, or other services relating to website hosting. However, **I do warrant that work I provide to you will continue to function as intended. Any updates or revisions you perform yourself run the risk of breaking it in ways I will not be held responsible for**, but I will do my best to help you fix the problems, if asked. I will charge you at my standard hourly rate for technical support for problems not directly caused by my work, or for errors caused by my work not brought to my attention within three months of project completion.

## Liability
I cannot guarantee that my work will always be error-free and so I can't be liable to you or any third party for damages, including lost profits, lost savings or other incidental, consequential, or special damages arising out of the operation of or inability to use the products I provide you with, even if you have advised me of the possibilities of such damages.
	
**You agree to regularly change all relevant passwords (FTP, website, host, databases, etc.) throughout our business relationship** and that I can't be held liable for any security breaches resulting from your failure to do so.
	
## Copyrights
You guarantee to me that any elements of text, graphics, photos, designs, trademarks, or other artwork that you provide me with are either owned by you, or that you have permission to use them.
	
You acknowledge that some of the images, code, templates, or other elements that I use may be provided by a third-party under a license that requires attribution. You authorize me to include such credit as needed.
	
When I receive your final payment for a project, copyright is automatically assigned as follows:

- You own any graphics and other visual elements that I create for you. I will give you a copy of all files, if requested, and you should store them safely, as I am not required to keep them.
- You also own text content, photographs and other data you provided, unless someone else does.
- I reserve the right to reuse any code or technique I developed for your project. The purpose of this is so that I don’t have to solve the same problem from scratch twice.
- I reserve the right to display and link to your completed project as part of my portfolio and to write about the project on websites, in articles, and in books about web design.

## Confidentiality
I will not share your credentials, account information, files, or business processes without your explicit authorization. I will do my best to guarantee the safety of any data you provide to me, including use of the SFTP protocol to access your server when available, generating randomized passwords for any accounts I create for you, and password-protecting any files I store locally in the course of my work for you. As far as long-term file retention is concerned, I try to only store copies of milestones in our development process, stripped of any sensitive information, for reference and learning purposes.
	
## Billable Hours
As your consultant, not all of my time will be spent coding for you. Instead, I’ll likely be talking to you, learning about what you’re trying to accomplish, doing research for you, and recommending and implementing tools for you to use. **Communication and research time is billable, and I will bill you for phone conversations, meetings, lengthy explanatory emails, and/or research.**
	
I will keep a timesheet of time spent per activity, date, and your balance for you to access at will, for all work billed hourly. (Note that I do not share my timesheets for fixed price work.)

For ongoing work, I am generally able to turn individual task items around in 24-72 hours during the business week. If you need work completed in under a day, tell me and I’ll do my best, schedule and work queue permitting. If you need a **guaranteed** turnaround time of under 24 hours, you will be billed for those hours worked at 1.5 times my standard hourly rate. I will never bill you for rush completion without first receiving your written acknowledgement and approval.
	
## Payments
I'm sure you understand how important it is that you pay the invoices that I send you promptly. As I'm also sure you'll want to stay friends, you agree to stick tight to the payment schedule we agree upon. Should you choose to pay via credit card, **you agree to pay the cost of merchant fees** (about 3% for PayPal), in addition to the invoiced amount. You are also responsible for any cross-border transaction fees. I will include these expenses in your invoice.
	
For ongoing work, I typically invoice around the middle and the end of the month. For project work, payment terms will be outlined in the project proposal. **All invoices are payable within 15 business days of receipt, and a USD 40 service charge is payable on all overdue balances for reissuing each invoice at 30, 45, 60, 75 and 90 days from the date of original invoice.**
	
## Foreign Payments
Since I am an American living in Singapore, running a Singaporean company and dealing with many US clients, I try to bill all non-local clients in USD for everyone’s convenience. Invoices may list a US mailing address and/or instruct you to make checks payable to "Inneo, LLC". This is my US company, which holds the money on behalf of Inneo Pte. Ltd. and helps facilitate the regular transfer of income into SDG. Regardless of the payable company, the work is being done by Inneo Pte. Ltd.
	
## Miscellaneous
You can't transfer this contract to anyone else without my permission. This contract stays in place and need not be renewed for future projects between us. If for some reason one part of this contract becomes invalid or unenforceable, the remaining parts of it remain in place.
	
This contract is based heavily off of [Contract Killer](http://stuffandnonsense.co.uk/blog/about/contract_killer_the_next_hit/) and the [AIGA Standard Form of Agreement for Design Services](http://www.aiga.org/content.cfm/standard-agreement). (Just giving credit where credit's due.)
	
If any provision of this agreement shall be unlawful, void, or for any reason unenforceable, then that provision shall be deemed severable from this agreement and shall not affect the validity and enforceability of any remaining provisions.
	
## Project Proposals
When requested or for larger work, I will submit a project proposal for your review and agreement. Project proposals typically include a detailed and comprehensive scope of the work to be done, a timeline for presentation of deliverables, cost, and payment terms. In the event of a contradiction of terms between this contract and the project proposal, the latter’s terms shall supersede the former’s, but only for that project.
	
## Early Termination
If you want to cancel the project, then I certainly won’t force you to complete it, but **you agree to pay me for the hours I worked, at my standard hourly rate**, regardless of whether I’m charging you by the hour or by the project. In the interests of transparency, I will provide you with a breakdown of the time spent per task type on the project, if requested to do so.

## Termination Due to Inactivity
Additionally, I retain the right to unilaterally terminate this agreement if more than 10 business days pass after the agreed upon project deadline and the project has not been completed due to significant delays caused by your failure to provide me with requested content, feedback, or work sign-offs. ‘Significant delays’ here are understood to mean situations where more than 50% of the total length of the project, in days, are spent waiting on actions from you. If I exercise this clause, you agree to pay me for the hours I worked between the date of my written notice of termination and your last payment, at my standard hourly rate. Note that clause only applies for fixed-rate projects.

## Browser Compatibility
The landscape of web browsers and devices changes regularly and my approach is to look forward, not back. With that in mind I will test any markup and CSS that I make for you in the current stable version of the four major desktop browsers by market share, as well as in iOS. Users of older or less capable browsers or devices will experience a design that is appropriate to the capabilities of their software.
		
I am happy to design your site responsively, so that it will dynamically restyle to better fit different device sizes. However, I don't code responsive design by default, so please let me know you want this feature as early as possible, since it will likely change my development approach and cost estimate.
						
For Microsoft Internet Explorer 8, I guarantee layout compatibility, meaning that site elements will appear where they should be on the page, but they probably will not look as good as on modern browsers. (For example, IE8 doesn't render shadows, gradients, or rounded corners.)
						
I will not test old or abandoned browsers, for example Microsoft Internet Explorer 6 or 7 or previous versions of Apple's Safari, Mozilla Firefox, or Google Chrome. If you need me to consider these older browsers, I will charge you at my standard hourly rate.

## Design Fidelity
If you're hiring me to code your wireframes, PSDs, or other designs, please understand that my role as a developer is one of a translator. I break down the designs you provide and rebuild them in a different medium, taking into account constraints such as browser compatibility, accessibility, performance, and likely alternative use-cases. As such, the finished web product won't be a 'pixel perfect' replica of your design, but rather a 'reasonable translation' of it. I'll do my best to match your original and address any specific differences you note, but I want the product I develop for you to load fast, adjust to any content you give it, use quality code, and be usable for as many people as possible - in addition to looking great.
						
## Revision
You will have the opportunity to make up to **two rounds of revisions**, within scope. If you're not happy with the designs at this stage, you will pay me in full for all of the work I have produced until that point and you may either cancel this contract or continue to commission me to make further revisions at my standard rate. Although I may show you the in-development product, I prefer to wait until development is mostly finished to ask you for these revisions, so that you don't have spend time reporting issues I already know about.

## Acceptance of Contract
*The action of sending and receipt of this agreement via electronic method will hold both of us in acceptance of these terms. I, as sender, and you, as recipient, will acknowledge acceptance of these terms either through an e-mail noting acceptance, a physical signature, or acceptance is acknowledged at the beginning of any work on said project. Electronic signatures shall be considered legal and binding.*
