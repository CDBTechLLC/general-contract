# Work Authorization
**Client (you)**:
**Developer (me)**: Cooper Dukes @Inneo Pte. Ltd.
**Project**: 
**Hours Authorized**:

You authorize me to work on the above project for hours **not to exceed** the amount above.

We've already discussed the specifics of the work to be done, and you will be billed for hours worked, at our contracted hourly rate.

This work can commence once we've both signed, and any authorized time expires 90 days from completion of signing.

*Note that work authorizations are only required when hourly billings are expected to exceed 15 hours for a single set of items. For minor ongoing development items, assent via email is fine.*
